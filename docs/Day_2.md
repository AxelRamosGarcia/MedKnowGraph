## Day 2 Progress (July 31, 2025)

**Objective:** Successfully deploy the Blackbook Knowledge Graph (KG) to a remote, online Neo4j instance and establish programmatic access from the remote Ubuntu server.

**Achievements Today:**

* **Neo4j AuraDB Free (Sandbox) Instance Provisioned:**
    * A new Neo4j AuraDB Free instance was successfully created in the cloud. This provides a fully managed, accessible environment for the Blackbook KG.
* **Blackbook KG Data Imported to AuraDB:**
    * The `Diagnosis` and `Symptom` nodes, along with `INDICATES` relationships (from `blackbook_diagnosis_nodes.csv`, `blackbook_symptom_nodes.csv`, and `blackbook_symptom_diagnosis_relationships.csv`), were successfully imported into the newly provisioned Neo4j AuraDB Free instance using the Aura Console's data import tools.
    * Verified data integrity and counts (5111 nodes) directly within the Neo4j AuraDB Browser.
* **Established Remote Access for Blackbook KG:**
    * After troubleshooting various connection methods (Query API vs. Bolt Driver with different ports/protocols), a stable and working connection was established from the remote Ubuntu server to the Neo4j AuraDB Sandbox.
    * The `kg_query_manager.py` script was successfully refactored to utilize the `Neo4jQuery` class and connect via a **direct Bolt connection (`bolt://<AURA_IP>:7687`)** using the official `neo4j` Python driver.
    * This connection was validated by successfully querying the node count (5111) from the remote server.

**Key Learning Points & Challenges Addressed:**

* **AuraDB Free Connection Nuances:** Explored different connection strategies (Bolt over SSL on port 443, Query API on HTTPS, direct Bolt on port 7687) and found the specific configuration that reliably works for the Sandbox tier with the Python `neo4j` driver. This involved iterative testing of URI formats and underlying protocols.
* **Python Driver Configuration:** Ensured correct installation of necessary libraries (`python-dotenv`, `neo4j`) and proper configuration of environment variables (`.env`) for remote access credentials and URI.
* **Modular Code Structure:** Adapted `kg_query_manager.py` to a class-based `Neo4jQuery` structure for improved maintainability and reusability of database operations within the upcoming AI assistant.

**Next Steps:**

* Begin development of the AI Assistant's core logic, leveraging the established `Neo4jQuery` class and its methods (`get_initial_diagnoses`, `get_related_symptoms`, `refine_diagnosis_by_multiple_symptoms`) to interact with the online Blackbook Knowledge Graph.
* Continue monitoring the MIMIC-III data import process on the remote Ubuntu server. This large dataset will reside separately for now.

**How to add this to your GitHub repository:**

1.  **Open your project locally:** Navigate to your `MedKnowGraph` directory on your local machine (where your git repository is).
2.  **Create/Edit the Markdown file:**
    * If you have a `README.md`, open it in a text editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.) and append the content under a new heading.
    * If you're creating a new file, save the content as `PROGRESS_LOG.md` in the root of your `MedKnowGraph` repository.
3.  **Commit your changes:**
    ```bash
    git add . # Adds all changed/new files
    git commit -m "Day 2: Successfully deployed Blackbook KG to Neo4j AuraDB and established remote access."
    git push origin main # Or whatever your main branch is called
    ```

This clear documentation will be very helpful as your project evolves! Now, let's get ready for the AI Assistant!
